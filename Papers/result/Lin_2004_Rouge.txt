Resum√© : ROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy forGisting Evaluation. It includes measures to automatically determine the quality of a summary bycomparing it to other (ideal) summaries created byhumans. The measures count the number of overlapping units such as n-gram, word sequences, andword pairs between the computer-generated summary to be evaluated and the ideal summaries created by humans. This paper introduces four differentROUGE measures: ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W,and ROUGE-S included in the ROUGE summarization evaluation package and their evaluatio ns. Threeof them have been used in the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2004, a large-scalesummarization evaluation sponsored by NIST.
