Titre :  Artex is another text summarizer
Resumé : This paper describes Artex, another algorithm for Automatic Text Summarization.In order to rank sentences, a simple inner product is calculated between each sentence, adocument vector (text topic) and a lexical vector (vocabulary used by a sentence). Summaries are then generated by assembling the highest ranked sentences. No ruled-basedlinguistic post-processing is necessary in order to obtain summaries. Tests over severaldatasets (coming from Document Understanding Conferences (DUC), Text Analysis Conference (TAC), evaluation campaigns, etc.) in French, English and Spanish have shownthat Artex summarizer achieves interesting results.
